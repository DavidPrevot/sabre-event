2.0.0-stable (2014-??-??)
	* Changed: EventEmitter::listeners now returns just the callbacks for an
	  event, and no longer returns the list by reference. The list is now
	  automatically sorted by priority.
	* Update: Speed improvements.
	* Changed: Now uses psr-4 autoloading.
	* Added: When calling emit, it's now possible to specify a callback that
	  will be triggered after each method handled. This is dubbed the
	  'continueCallback' and can be used to implement strategy patterns.

	* Added: once, to only listen to an event emitting once.
